# Model Deployment App
This project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using Flask. The Random Forest Regressor Model is served via an API endpoint for inference. The web application allows users to interact with the model through a simple interface

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file to serve the model
- `model.pkl`: The random forest regressor model
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the app to run
- `templates/`: Folder containing `index.html`
